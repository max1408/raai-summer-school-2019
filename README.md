## Task and Motion Planning in a Traffic Flow

### Description

More and more cities are transforming to a new stage in their development becoming so called "smart cities". The key concept of "smart cities" is incorporation of information technologies and communication devices to enhance the quality of life of their citizens. The range of problems which could be solved using constantly developing sensor devices and Internet of Things varies from transportation problem to such typical urban problems as energy consummation and waste control. In the same time all this data could be also provided to urban dwellers and used by them to improve their everyday experience.
Furthermore a huge progress were made in the field of Artificial intelligence, which allows to implement in reality such once thought futuristic technology as unmanned automated vehicle (UAV) control systems. 
In our work we try to combine developments in both of this areas ("smart cities" and self-driving cars) to make an improvement in each of them.

Currently there are still several areas which pose a significant difficulties as for development of cities and for self-driving cars. The most important of them is traffic problem. It makes development of self driving cars in situation with highly unpredictable urban environment extremely challenging and poison experience of people living in areas with constant traffic jams.
In the work we concentrate on one of the sub-problem such as traffic flow on road intersections. We suggest to use newly available technology and devices to improve behaviour of self-driving cars on crossroads.

As an idea we suggest to use a data from a four-way intersection which then provided to a car. The way this data is provided can be arrange in several different ways, e.g. by cameras which mounted near intersections or by a quad-copter. The data is provided as a photo of current situation on the road and transferred to a self driving car agent which then can use this information to improve its decisions on intersection. In this work we concentrate on developing an environment which can simulate the process of cars movements on crossroad and then train an agent of a self driving car after receiving data.
